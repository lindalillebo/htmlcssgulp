				<h2>About London</h2>
				<p>It's an european melting pot, with more than 8 million people and a diverse range of cultures. The city is a
					centre
					of arts, fashion, entertainment and history. There are so many historic sites in London, its impossible to see
					it all in one day. The city is heavily traficated and getting around it can take much longer than it has to.</p>
